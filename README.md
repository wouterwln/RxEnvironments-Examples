# RxEnvironments Example Environments

This repository accompanies the paper "Reactive Environments for Active Inference Agents with RxEnvironments.jl", which introduces the [`RxEnvironments.jl`](https://www.github.com/biaslab/RxEnvironments.jl) package for creating reactive environments for active inference agents. The three examples in this repository each show a different key feature of the package:
 - The MountainCar example shows how to elicit proprioceptive feedback from the environment when conducting an action.
 - The FootballEnv shows how to create a multi-agent environment with zero additional overhead.
 - The HearingAid example shows how to create an environment with a complex communication network between entities.
